There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving!

The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.\\nAfter a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).\\nThe parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old. The only thing available is coffee in the lobby which is decent.\\nAll in all, poor service, minimal amenities, small rooms, small bathrooms, no view, but great location. Some distance from the metro (either McPherson station or Dupont station). Try to look for better if available.</td>\n",

They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful.

Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.\\nI did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.\\nNeedless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at.

The staff was friendly and attentive. The elevators are tiny (about -' by -'). The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving! I would stay here again for business, but would not come here on vacation.  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    i stayed at the crown plaza april   april   the staff was friendly and attentive the elevators are tiny about  by  the food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side of course this is washington dc there is no pool and little for children to do my room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person the tv is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels there was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach it appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day i reported a light bulb was burned out it was never replaced ice machines are on the odd numbered floors but the one on my floor did not work i encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and i mentioned the ice machine to them severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints im not sure how they knew what room i was in that was a little unnerving i would stay here again for business but would not come here on vacation\n",

When we got there the front desk manager gave us a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"smoking\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" room. I argued that I have a little baby and I would not have booked the room had I known it was smoking. The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.\\nAfter a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).\\nThe parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old.

They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of.

Though not the fanciest hotel, we love the fact that we can walk the - or so miles to Fenway. It is clean and the staff is very accomodating. My only complaint is that the fan in the bathroom was noisy and went on automatically when you turned the light on and we tried to keep the light off as much as possible. We've stayed in pricier hotels which charged for internet and breakfast and these are both included.

SF is expensive, but we found this little hotel in a super location for a very reasonable price. By no means is it a --star hotel, but the room was clean, nice & well-appointed with quaint charm, despite being a bit small. Regardless of that, the staff was very helpful. I particularly enjoyed the wine-tasting evenings & the helpful, polite front desk.\\nOverall, I'd recommend this place for singles or couples, but for children present, you probably need a bit bigger room. For the location & proximity to everything (including a marvelous little Mexican restaurant around the corner), you can't beat this place for the price. SF is a magical city with plenty of things to do, so I'd recommend just crashing here & seeing the wonderful surroundings more than hanging out in a room all day.\\nWould recommend again for a getaway for -, but not for families because of the room size.  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               my wife  i stayed in this glorious city a while back sf is expensive but we found this little hotel in a super location for a very reasonable price by no means is it a star hotel but the room was clean nice  wellappointed with quaint charm despite being a bit small regardless of that the staff was very helpful i particularly enjoyed the winetasting evenings  the helpful polite front desk\\noverall id recommend this place for singles or couples but for children present you probably need a bit bigger room for the location  proximity to everything including a marvelous little mexican restaurant around the corner you cant beat this place for the price sf is a magical city with plenty of things to do so id recommend just crashing here  seeing the wonderful surroundings more than hanging out in a room all day\\nwould recommend again for a getaway for  but not for families because of the room size\n",

The staff was friendly and attentive. The elevators are tiny (about -' by -'). The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving! I would stay here again for business, but would not come here on vacation.  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              i stayed at the crown plaza april   april   the staff was friendly and attentive the elevators are tiny about  by  the food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side of course this is washington dc there is no pool and little for children to do my room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person the tv is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels there was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach it appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day i reported a light bulb was burned out it was never replaced ice machines are on the odd numbered floors but the one on my floor did not work i encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and i mentioned the ice machine to them severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints im not sure how they knew what room i was in that was a little unnerving i would stay here again for business but would not come here on vacation\n",

When we got there the front desk manager gave us a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"smoking\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" room. I argued that I have a little baby and I would not have booked the room had I known it was smoking. The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.\\nAfter a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).\\nThe parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old.

All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.\\nThe rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.\\nI did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.\\nNeedless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at.

Great location for visiting Inner Harbor, getting to Fells Point, Orioles games etc. SuperShuttle from BWI worked great both ways. TV remotes in both rooms were terrible but we didn't watch much TV so not a big deal.

Though not the fanciest hotel, we love the fact that we can walk the - or so miles to Fenway. It is clean and the staff is very accomodating. My only complaint is that the fan in the bathroom was noisy and went on automatically when you turned the light on and we tried to keep the light off as much as possible. We've stayed in pricier hotels which charged for internet and breakfast and these are both included.

SF is expensive, but we found this little hotel in a super location for a very reasonable price. By no means is it a --star hotel, but the room was clean, nice & well-appointed with quaint charm, despite being a bit small. Regardless of that, the staff was very helpful. I particularly enjoyed the wine-tasting evenings & the helpful, polite front desk.\\nOverall, I'd recommend this place for singles or couples, but for children present, you probably need a bit bigger room. For the location & proximity to everything (including a marvelous little Mexican restaurant around the corner), you can't beat this place for the price. SF is a magical city with plenty of things to do, so I'd recommend just crashing here & seeing the wonderful surroundings more than hanging out in a room all day.\\nWould recommend again for a getaway for -, but not for families because of the room size.  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             my wife  i stayed in this glorious city a while back sf is expensive but we found this little hotel in a super location for a very reasonable price by no means is it a star hotel but the room was clean nice  wellappointed with quaint charm despite being a bit small regardless of that the staff was very helpful i particularly enjoyed the winetasting evenings  the helpful polite front deskoverall id recommend this place for singles or couples but for children present you probably need a bit bigger room for the location  proximity to everything including a marvelous little mexican restaurant around the corner you cant beat this place for the price sf is a magical city with plenty of things to do so id recommend just crashing here  seeing the wonderful surroundings more than hanging out in a room all daywould recommend again for a getaway for  but not for families because of the room size\n",
